# Video Tag Player

Inspired by Udemy's tag functionality for online videos, here is a version that can do the same thing for offline videos and audios. This application is completely free!

## Components

This app can be considered mostly a wrapper around [LibVLCSharp](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/LibVLCSharp/-/tree/3.x). Tag files are saved with " (Note).yaml" suffix along side video file.

## Feature

* Add/Modify/Remove tags add play points in a video/audio

## ToDo

* Add keyboard navigation (skip forward a few seconds)
